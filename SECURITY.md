# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the **Jekwwer/svg-workspace** repository
and provides instructions for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

I actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version            | Supported             |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| [`v1.0.1`][v1.0.1] | ✅ Actively supported |
| Older versions     | ❌ Not supported      |

If your project is using an unsupported version, I recommend upgrading to the latest version
to benefit from security updates and fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository:

1. **Private Disclosure via Email**
   Please send an email to [report@jekwwer.com][report@jekwwer.com] with the following details:

   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Affected versions (if applicable).
   - Any suggested fixes or workarounds.

2. **Private Security Advisory on GitHub**
   Alternatively, you can submit a report via GitHub Security Advisories:
   - Navigate to the repository's [Security Advisories][security-advisories].
   - Click **Create security advisory** and follow the instructions.

I aim to respond to vulnerability reports within **48 hours**
and provide a resolution or update within **7 days**.
